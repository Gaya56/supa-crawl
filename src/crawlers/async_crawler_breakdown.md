# Breakdown of async_crawler.py

## Overview
The `async_crawler.py` file implements an advanced asynchronous web crawler using the Crawl4AI library. It supports multiple URL crawling, LLM (Large Language Model) integration for data extraction, and storage of results in a Supabase database.

## Key Components

### Imports
- **Standard Libraries**: `asyncio`, `json`, `os`, `datetime`, `typing`
- **Crawl4AI Library**: Classes for web crawling, browser configuration, and LLM integration.
- **Custom Modules**: Configuration and storage handlers.

### Class: `AdvancedWebCrawler`
This class encapsulates the functionality of the web crawler.

#### Initialization (`__init__` method)
- Configures the browser for stealth mode and sets up crawler run parameters.
- Initializes the Supabase storage handler.

#### Methods
1. **`crawl_with_memory_adaptive_dispatcher`**: Crawls multiple URLs using a memory-adaptive dispatcher to manage resources efficiently.
2. **`crawl_with_semaphore_dispatcher`**: Uses a semaphore dispatcher for simple concurrency control.
3. **`crawl_with_llm_analysis`**: Integrates LLM analysis during crawling for structured data extraction.
4. **`crawl_and_store_in_supabase`**: Crawls URLs and stores results in Supabase, utilizing LLM analysis for enhanced data.

### Error Handling
- Each method includes error handling to manage failures during crawling and data extraction.

### Logging
- The crawler provides console output for tracking progress and results, including success and failure messages.

## Usage
To use the `AdvancedWebCrawler`, instantiate the class and call the desired crawling method with a list of URLs. Ensure that the environment is properly configured with necessary API keys and database credentials.
