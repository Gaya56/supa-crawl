# Implementation Summary: Dashboard-Aggregated Prediction Market Crawler

## üìã Project Status: SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ Core Implementation Completed

**Date:** September 10, 2025  
**Status:** Live prediction market data extraction with dashboard aggregation  
**Performance:** Successfully extracting and storing current live data from multiple sources

## üéØ What We Built

### 1. **Architectural Transformation**
- **Before:** General web crawler with basic content extraction
- **After:** Specialized prediction market data extractor with structured schema validation
- **Key Addition:** Dashboard aggregation capability for comprehensive multi-source data

### 2. **Code Additions Summary**

#### **Schema Layer** (`src/models/schemas.py`)
```python
class PredictionMarketBet(BaseModel):
    website_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the prediction market website")
    bet_title: str = Field(..., description="Title/description of the betting market")
    odds: str = Field(..., description="Current odds or probability")
    summary: str = Field(..., description="Brief summary of what the market is predicting")
```
**Purpose:** Structured data validation matching Supabase Testing table

#### **Storage Layer** (`src/storage/supabase_handler.py`)
```python
async def store_prediction_market_data(self, prediction_market: 'PredictionMarketBet', source_url: str) -> bool:
    # Perfect field mapping to Testing table
    result = self.client.table("Testing").insert({
        "source_url": source_url,
        "website_name": prediction_market.website_name,
        "bet_title": prediction_market.bet_title,
        "odds": prediction_market.odds,
        "summary": prediction_market.summary
    }).execute()
```
**Purpose:** Seamless database storage with error handling

#### **Extraction Layer** (`src/crawlers/async_crawler.py`)
```python
async def crawl_prediction_markets_with_llm(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict]:
    # LLM-powered extraction with schema validation
    extraction_strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
        provider="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        schema=PredictionMarketBet.model_json_schema(),
        instruction="Extract all available prediction market data..."
    )
    # Array response handling for multiple markets per page
```
**Purpose:** Intelligent data extraction with GPT-4o-mini
