# Code Snippets Added for Prediction Market Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This document details all the code snippets that were added to transform the general web crawler into a specialized prediction market data extractor.

## 1. Schema Definition (`src/models/schemas.py`)

### Added PredictionMarketBet Schema

```python
class PredictionMarketBet(BaseModel):
    """
    Pydantic schema for prediction market bet extraction
    Matches Supabase Testing table structure for seamless storage
    """
    website_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the prediction market website")
    bet_title: str = Field(..., description="Title/description of the betting market")
    odds: str = Field(..., description="Current odds or probability (e.g., '52% Yes', '1.85')")
    summary: str = Field(..., description="Brief summary of what the market is predicting")
```

**Purpose:** Structured data validation for prediction market extraction
**Location:** Added after existing PageSummary class
**Dependencies:** Uses existing BaseModel and Field imports

## 2. Database Storage (`src/storage/supabase_handler.py`)

### Added TYPE_CHECKING Import

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Optional, List, Dict, Any
```

**Purpose:** Enable type hints for development without circular imports

### Added Prediction Market Storage Method

```python
async def store_prediction_market_data(self, prediction_market: 'PredictionMarketBet', source_url: str) -> bool:
    """
    Store prediction market data in Supabase Testing table
    
    Args:
        prediction_market: PredictionMarketBet object with market data
        source_url: Source URL where data was extracted from
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if storage successful, False otherwise
    """
    if TYPE_CHECKING:
        from ..models.schemas import PredictionMarketBet
        
    try:
        # Insert data into Testing table with perfect field mapping
        result = self.client.table("Testing").insert({
            "source_url": source_url,
            "website_name": prediction_market.website_name,
            "bet_title": prediction_market.bet_title,
            "odds": prediction_market.odds,
            "summary": prediction_market.summary
        }).execute()
        
        if result.data:
            print(f"✓ Stored prediction market: {prediction_market.bet_title} from {prediction_market.website_name}")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"✗ Failed to store prediction market data for {source_url}")
            return False
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Error storing prediction market data: {str(e)}")
        return False
```

**Purpose:** Store extracted prediction market data in Supabase
**Location:** Added after existing store_page_summary method
**Key Features:** 
- Perfect field mapping to Testing table
- Comprehensive error handling
- Success logging

## 3. Crawler Enhancement (`src/crawlers/async_crawler.py`)

### Added Required Imports

```python
import json
from ..models.schemas import PredictionMarketBet
```

**Purpose:** Enable JSON parsing and prediction market schema usage

### Added Prediction Market LLM Extraction Method

```python
async def crawl_prediction_markets_with_llm(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Crawl prediction market websites with LLM-powered data extraction
    
    Args:
        urls: List of prediction market URLs to crawl
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing extracted prediction market data
    """
    print(f"🎲 Starting prediction market LLM crawl for {len(urls)} URLs")
    
    # Configure LLM extraction strategy for prediction markets
    extraction_strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
        provider="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        api_token=self.openai_api_key,
        schema=PredictionMarketBet.model_json_schema(),
        extraction_type="schema",
        apply_chunking=False,
        instruction="Extract all available prediction market data from this page. Include market titles, current odds/probabilities, and brief descriptions of what each market is predicting. Focus on active betting markets with current odds."
    )
    
    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        js_code="""
        // Wait for dynamic content to load
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
        
        // Scroll to load more content
        window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
        """
    )
    
    results = []
    
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True, config=self.config) as crawler:
        for url in urls:
            try:
                result = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=crawler_config)

                        if isinstance(parsed_data, list):
                            print(f"📊 LLM returned {len(parsed_data)} prediction markets")
                            for market_data in parsed_data:
                                if isinstance(market_data, dict) and not market_data.get('error', False):

                                        'success': True
                                    })
                        else:
                            # Handle single object response
                            if isinstance(parsed_data, dict) and not parsed_data.get('error', False):
